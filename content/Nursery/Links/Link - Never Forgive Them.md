**Link: [Never Forgive Them](https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/)**

_NOTE: This article swears frequently_

An opinion piece (though backed with many resources) that describes how the internet has degraded over time. User experience has greatly declined, and all because tech companies are focused on growth at all costs. This is not something that we should accept as "just the way things are".
