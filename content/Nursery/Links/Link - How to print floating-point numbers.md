A description of how _Dragon 2_ (the floating point printing algorithm that Python uses) works.

It can be summarized as follows:
1. find $x$ such that $v' = v \cdot 10^{-x} < 2^p$ holds
2. print the integer part $k$ of $v'$
3. print a decimal point
4. compute the remaining precision $n = p - \text{ceil}(\log_2(k))$
5. print the fractional part with a precision of $n$ (this prints the integer $F$)
6. print $\cdot 10$
7. print $x$ as an exponent
